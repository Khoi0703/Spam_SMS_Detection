# Spam SMS Classification using NLP

## Introduction
This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning to classify SMS messages into two categories: **Spam** and **Ham**. The model is built on an SMS dataset and employs the Naive Bayes algorithm for classification.

## Contents
- **Data**: The SMS dataset contains messages labeled as "ham" (not spam) and "spam."
- **Method**: Utilizes `TfidfVectorizer` to transform text into vectors and `MultinomialNB` to train the model.
- **Results**: The model returns accuracy and classification reports for the test dataset.
